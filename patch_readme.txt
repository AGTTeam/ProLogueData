                   *****************************************

If this is your first time patching a game, we recommend taking a quick look at our beginner's guide before continuing. https://agtteam.tumblr.com/beginnersguide

Before you can play the translation, you'll need to patch the game on a computer using a legal copy of the ROM, which you must supply yourself. (Note that you cannot patch the translation onto the original game cartridge.)

You can either patch the game online, via the ROMhacking.net download page, or locally by downloading an additional piece of software.

                         ============================
                                ONLINE METHOD        
                         ============================

-On the ROMhacking.net download page, navigate to "Patch Online NOW!" under the 'Links' header.
-Upload your copy of the ROM using the "Choose File" button.
-Click "Apply Patch", and wait for the download to complete. You should now have a patched copy of the ROM, labelled '-input source- (patched)'.

                         ===========================
                               SOFTWARE METHOD      
                         ===========================

-Download DeltaPatcher from https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/
-Extract the file, and run either DeltaPatcher or DeltaPatcherLite
-'Original file' should be your copy of the ROM as an '.nds' filetype.
-For 'XDelta patch', choose the 'ProLoguePatch.xdelta' file.
-Hit apply patch, and you're good to go!
*Note that this will overwrite your original file. If you'd like to keep a copy of it instead, change the settings by clicking the cog icon, and tick "Backup original file". This will create a new '--PATCHED.nds' file instead.

                   *****************************************
                   *         II. Running the Game          *
                   *****************************************

You can play the patched game on the emulator or hardware of your choice.

                         ===========================
                                 ON HARDWARE        
                         ===========================

To play the game on the original NDS/DS Lite, you will need to purchase an extra piece of hardware called a flashcart (alt. flashcard), which looks like a DS game cartridge and includes a slot for a MicroSD card. There are also carts compatible with the DSi and 2/3DS models, so please look before you buy.

Alternatively, if you own a DSi or 2/3DS, you have the option of installing custom firmware (CFW) and a DS Game Forwarder such as TWiLight Menu++ to load DS games directly from your console's internal SD card.

See https://dsi.cfw.guide/ (DSi) or https://3ds.hacks.guide/ (2/3DS) for more information and instructions.

                         ===========================
                                 VIA EMULATOR       
                         ===========================

DS emulators are available on a range of hardware, including PC, mobile and other game consoles. See below for a list of the most popular recommended emulators.

Windows 7+, Mac OS, Linux - MelonDS

Android – DraStic (Premium), RetroArch (Free)

iOS - RetroArch

Nintendo Switch – MelonDS (You will need to install custom firmware on a compatible Switch first.)

                   *               III. Notes              *
                   *****************************************

CHEATS
The patch comes with two translated cheats files ready to be used with the emulators MelonDS or DeSmuME if so desired (MelonDS_cheats.mch and DeSmuME_cheats.dct respectively). The codes can also be used with other emulators/flashcarts, however may require you to do some additional setup first. Please consult a guide relating to your specific software for instructions on what to do.

Be advised that use of cheats may prevent you from triggering Watari's message during replays of the game, stopping you from being able to unlock the true ending.

NAME FLIP
In Japanese, a person's name is generally written with their family name first, followed by their given name (e.g., Doe John). This has been flipped in the patch, and the player's name should be input in English name order (e.g., John Doe).

The game utilizes a relationship system, whereby once you reach a certain level in the L Communicator, L will start to call you by your first name. If you have previously created a save using a Japanese name, it will still be compatible, however characters may refer to you by the wrong name (e.g., by using your given name rather than your family name and vice versa.)

L COMMUNICATOR DEMO
In the "Extras" menu, it is possible to send a trial version of the L Communicator to another DS via Wireless Communication. This has been fully translated, but due to the DS' security protection, can only be played on compatible emulators (see instructions below) or a flashed DS (see https://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/FlashMe for more).

Using Download Play on MelonDS:
1) Download and install the latest version of MelonDS from https://melonds.kuribo64.net/downloads.php
2) Navigate to Config > Emu Settings > DS-Mode and check "Use external BIOS/firmware files". Then, use the Browse buttons to locate the DS BIOS files. (N.B. You will need to provide these files yourself, they are not included in the emulator/patch downloads.)
4) Load up the patched game, navigate to Extras > Send Demo, and press "Yes". The game should now be ready to send the demo and looking for devices.
5) Back in the MelonDS toolbar, go to System > Multiplayer > Launch new instance.
6) In the new window of MelonDS which appears, go to File > Boot firmware to launch the DS home screen and start DS Download Play. The game should be picked up automatically. Follow the steps to download the demo. If the download gets stuck, return to the original window and press "Send Demo" and "Yes" again. The download should then complete.

OPENING SUBTITLES
Textboxes were added for several lines at the beginning of the game, which previously only contained audio. These are:
"Allow me to ask a few questions."
"By the way, how do you feel about sweets?"
"I see. I think we'll get along just fine."
"Is that so? I quite like them, myself."
"One last thing. Do you have what it takes to stand up to evil?"

MINOR TWEAKS
The labels on two door images were changed from "Control Room" to "Staff Room", to reflect the content of the rooms.

A line of uneditable text which read "緊急回避 (avert disaster)" was removed from the small trap emergency measures screen.

The text for obtaining a new wallpaper in the L Communicator was changed from being centered to left-aligned, due to an issue with the VWF in that section.

KNOWN BUGS
These issues are inherited from the original game:
- The step objective images for three late-stage small traps are incorrect.
- During the end credits, the text may appear to flicker (on hardware), and/or black bars may temporarily appear (on emulator).
